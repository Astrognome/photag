Here's my image tagging program

Currently in highly experimental stage, it can handle a lot of images in the databse but when trying to handle large queries in the UI it gets very slow.

Requires PyQt5, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite.

As far as running this, make sure you have those libraries installed, be cd'd into the photag directory, and run it. There is no packaging yet.
